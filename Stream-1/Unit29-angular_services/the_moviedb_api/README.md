# mdb-initial 

This project is a initial version of a student project used for
learning the AngularJS frame work.

It uses the MoviesDB Api as its basis see http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#

To clone the application use the usual git clone command from a command tool

1/ git clone https://github.com/lillylangtree/mdb-initial.git

2/ the clone will create a mdb-initial/MoviesDB folder in the current folder

The application includes a package.json file which will allow you to run a 
local http server. You need to have npm installed to do this.

cd to mdb-initial/MoviesDB folder, the git clone creates this folder for you

1/ issue command npm start

2/ in a browser navigate to localhost:8000 (you can change the port setting
   in the package.json file if you wish)

3/ Home page should appear

If you don't have npm installed you can still run the application just
copy the main folder to where your files get served from locally
